                    <p>Did you know
                        that you have rights? The constitution says you do!
                        And so do I.

                        Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?

                        For a substantial fee, and I do mean substantial, you and your loved ones can vanish.
                        Untraceable.

                        I want it in a money order and make it out to Ice Station Zebra Associates. That's my
                        loan out. It's totally legit …
                        it's done just for tax purposes. After that we can discuss Visa or Mastercard, but
                        definitely not American Express, so
                        don't even ask, all right?

                        You're a high-risk client. You're gonna need the deluxe service. It's gonna cost you.

                        If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin
                        Costner, and it worked because
                        I believed it.

                        I never should have let my dojo membership run out.

                        Better safe than sorry. That's my motto.

                        As to your dead guy, occupational hazard. Drug dealer getting shot? I'm gonna go out on
                        a limb here and say it's been
                        known to happen."

                        Don't drink and drive, but if you do, call me.
